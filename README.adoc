= WebSocket Client in Dart

This simple WebSocket client connects to a given WebSocket URL and sends three texts with a delay of a few seconds. Received data is printed.

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
> dart pub get

# echo.websocket.org is used by default:
> dart run wsclient.dart
----

Now try https://github.com/buehren/websocket-echo-server-quarkus[WebSocket echo server].

The Dart client works with WebSocket echo server running on localhost:
[source%nowrap,bash]
----
> dart run wsclient.dart --url ws://localhost:8080/websocket

2021-02-26 21:25:22.418794 WebSocket readyState: 1
2021-02-26 21:25:23.446877 Sending 'hello'
2021-02-26 21:25:23.458083 Received data: echo of hello
2021-02-26 21:25:24.422013 Sending 'how are you?'
2021-02-26 21:25:24.422752 Received data: echo of how are you
2021-02-26 21:25:26.433450 Sending 'still there?'
2021-02-26 21:25:26.436280 Received data: echo of still there?

The Dart client does NOT work with WebSocket echo server running on Google Cloud Run -- the WebSocket is closed right after the Dart client sends data:
[source%nowrap,bash]
----
> dart run wsclient.dart --url wss://websocket-echo-server-quarkus-xxxxxxxxxx-xx.x.run.app/websocket

2021-02-26 21:25:40.539316 Starting connection attempt to wss://websocket-echo-server-quarkus-xxxxxxxxxx-xx.x.run.app/websocket ...

2021-02-26 21:25:41.851590 Sending 'hello'

But this client works with WebSocket echo server running on Google Cloud Run:
[source%nowrap,bash]
